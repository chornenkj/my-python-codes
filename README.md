My Python codes to solve various tasks

1. 'speech_recognition' - is a project to recognize speech from WAV-file
using 'speech_recognition' module and Google as a recognizer.

2. 'replace_with_dollar_sign' - a task to replace symbols in a string with dollar sign.
There are two ways to perform the task. And I used %%timeit magic function to compare their speed.
